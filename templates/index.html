            <p>
                This is a democratic plant care system, where users vote whether my plant, Silver, should be watered today. 
                Silver is a <a href="https://smartgardenguide.com/begonia-maculata-care/">Polka Dot Begonia (Begonia Maculata)</a> 
                and thrives in humid conditions. It's best when the soil is kept damp,
                but not soggy. Silver enjoys bright, indirect light, and too much light will fry the leaves!

            <h2>About Voting</h2>
            <p>
                You may vote once per day, resetting at midnight (Central Time). Feel free to check out the live data to make 
                an informed decision about whether Silver needs water today, or vote however you'd like! If the majority 
                votes in favor of watering Silver, the water pump will be activated at midnight.
