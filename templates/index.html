            <h2>Welcome to my Smart Garden</h2>
            <p>
                This is a democratic plant care system, where users vote whether my plant, Seymore, should be watered today. 
                Seymore is a <a href="https://www.costafarms.com//plants/nerve-plant">Nerve Plant (Fittonia 'Red Anne')</a> 
                and thrives in moist conditions. It's best when the soil is kept damp,
                but not soggy. Seymore enjoys low/medium light, and too much light will make his leaves crispy!

            <p>
                You may vote once per day, resetting at midnight (Central Time). Feel free to check out the live data to make 
                an informed decision about whether Seymore needs water today, or vote however you'd like! If the majority 
                votes in favor of watering Seymore, the water pump will be activated.
